# Datree Helm Plugin

A Helm plugin to validate charts against the Datree policy  

## Installation
```
helm plugin install https://github.com/datreeio/helm-datree
```
⚠️ Helm plugins are not supported on Windows OS ⚠️  
_Windows users can work around this by using [Helm under WSL](https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3#for-windows-using-wsl)_
</br>

### Update Datree's plugin version
```
helm plugin update datree
```
### Uninstall
```
helm plugin uninstall datree
```

## Usage

### Trigger datree policy check via the helm CLI
```
helm datree test [CHART_DIRECTORY]
```

### Passing arguments
If you need to pass helm arguments to your template, you will need to add `--` before them:
```
helm datree test [CHART_DIRECTORY] -- --values values.yaml --set name=prod
```
### Test files
By default, test files generated by Helm will be skipped. If you wish to include test files in your policy check, add the `--include-tests` flag:
```
helm datree test --include-tests [CHART_DIRECTORY]
```

### Check plugin version
```
helm datree version
```

### See help text
```
helm datree help
```

### Using other helm command
Helm might be installed through other tooling like microk8s. The `DATREE_HELM_COMMAND` allows specifying a command to run helm (default: `helm`):
```
DATREE_HELM_COMMAND="microk8s helm3" helm datree test [CHART_DIRECTORY]
```

## Testing multiple charts

If you have multiple charts inside a single directory, you can test all of them sequentially using the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

path="${1:-.}"
final_exit_code=0

while read -r helmchart; do
	dir="$(dirname "$helmchart")"
    echo "*** Proceeding to test Helm chart: $helmchart ***"
	set +e
	helm datree test "$dir"
	exitcode=$?
	set -e
	if [ "$exitcode" -gt "$final_exit_code" ]; then
        final_exit_code="$exitcode"
    fi
    echo ""
done < <(find "$path" -type f -name 'Chart.y*ml')

if [ "$final_exit_code" = 0 ]; then
    echo "Success"
else
    echo "Violations found, returning exit code $final_exit_code"
fi
exit "$final_exit_code"
```

The script will run a policy check against all charts before exiting, and return 0 only if no violations were found in any of them.  
This is useful for CI, to avoid the need to call `datree test` multiple times.  

## Examples

### Basic usage
```
helm plugin install https://github.com/datreeio/helm-datree
git clone git@github.com:datreeio/examples.git
helm datree test examples/helm-chart/nginx
```

### GitHub Workflow
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    
env:
  DATREE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DATREE_TOKEN }} 

jobs:
  k8sPolicyCheck:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
      - name: Run Datree Policy Check
        uses: datreeio/action-datree@main
        with:
          path: 'myChartDirectory'
          cliArguments: '--only-k8s-files'
          isHelmChart: true
          helmArguments: '--values values.yaml'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: plugin "datree" exited with error
This is actually expected behavior because it's raised by Helm itself every time a plugin returns a [non-zero exit code](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Exit-Status.html#:~:text=A%20non%2Dzero%20exit%20status,N%20as%20the%20exit%20status.).  
Therefore, if you will run datree plugin on a Chart that will pass the policy check, it will return 0 as exit code, and you will not see this error.

### K8s schema validation error
This error occurs when trying to scan Chart.yaml or values.yaml files instead of the chart directory.  
**Solution:** Pass the helm chart directory path to Datree's CLI, instead of to the file itself:  
* Correct - `helm datree test examples/helm-chart/nginx`
* Wrong - `helm datree test examples/helm-chart/nginx/values.yaml`

### The policy check returns false-positive results
The best way to determine if a false-positive result is a bug or a true misconfiguration, is by rendering the Kubernetes manifest with helm and then checking it manually:
```
helm template [CHART_DIRECTORY]
```
If after eyeballing the rendered manifest you still suspect it's a bug, please open an issue.
